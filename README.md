| 1.  | Today was the first day and it begins with the orientation program organised for all of us. In this firstly **Dr. Priyana maam** introduced us with our core department(CSE department). She has provided all the information related to the department along with the alumi's and projects made by the our seniors. After that, HOD maam **Dr. Kiran Jyoti** introduced the new study scheme which is implemented from our session. we are really very happy with the new intoduced scheme as it provides us a new opportunity for all of us to go for intership for 1 year. It will help us to gain more hand on experience from the companies. After the orientation program we went into our alloted slots and there our teacher (Priyanka maam) begins with a new operating system i.e. **linux** maam told us what it is actually and how it is more benefical to us than windows. proceeding further we learnt the ways to install and use it. as there are 2 ways for the same, we begins with the first one which was using **virtul box** and after installing that maam teaches us how to make a pendrive bootable for the second method. it was an interesting session as we were learing a totally new thing which is very amazing. |
| 2.  | we learnt the second method of installing the **linux** using **booting method**. after that we proceeds with the basics commands of creating, writing text,moving,copy a directory. it was more interesting than yesterday as we were coding a totally new language with a new interface. |
